Class Diagram
	-> Collect all class names														<--| Dictionary? (class foo, function bar)
	-> Collect all functions and assign them to thier respected class				<--|
	-> Put all info into boxes and draw to screen
	-> Connect lines between classes that interact w/ each other (?)
	
XAML Diagram
	-- Need to research XAML diagrams
	
Program Flow Diagram
	-> User pulls in project files and then sets which one is the main
	-> Starting from main, follow program through all the functions 
	   and follow the data flow as the program progresses (via function calls(?))
	-> Pull out function names and what class they come from
	-> As functions and classes are being pulled out, draw box containing
	   func & class to screen and draw line leading to the next eventual box.
	-> If the program ends then errase last line made
