Hello and Welcome to the Knight Documenter Wiki!

What is Knight Documenter?

Knight Documenter is a tool for programmers that will speed up the documentation pipeline by allowing a user to generate documentation at the click of a button! It will generate documentation such as comment extraction, class diagrams and even program flow charts! Then it will let the user choose from a variety of formats such as html files (for Wiki's like this one!).
