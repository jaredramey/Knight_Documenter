Doc Types:
	- Class Diagram
	- Program Flow Diagram
	- Comment Extraction
	
Classes:
	- Reader
		-> Open Files
		-> Parse for requested data
			[] Set up functions for specific extraction?
			[] Just parse for "Keyword"?
		-> Send Parsed info to data storage class
			[] Universal data type?
			[] figure out how to store and call different data
			   (i.e. String, Char, Dictionary or Custom type)
			   
	- Data
		-> Store All parsed data to be called later
		-> Custom storage for classes and their functions
			class Storage
			{
				string Name;
				list<string> functions;
			}
					OR
			class Storage
			{
				string Namel
				list<string> functions;
				list<string> refrences;
			}
			
	- Drawing
		-> Create New window
			[] Need to remember how to make a window to call on later in code. Should hide the interface.
		-> Create text in boxes
			[] Graphics rendering overview for WPF:
			   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/wpf-graphics-rendering-overview
		-> layout text boxes correctly
			[] Once the graphics rendering is figured out this should be easy.
		-> connect boxes with lines
			[] Follow the above reference and there is a section that talks about connecting lines via points on shapes.
		
	- Visual Docs
		-> Pull correct data from storage
		-> Use data w/ draw functions to create diagrams
		-> Let user save said diagrams to local machine
			[] Should make save/ load interface.
		
	- Text Docs
		-> Pull correct data from storage
		-> Take data and format properly to create Docs
			(Example)
			Doc Name
			Doc Type
			
				Comments from "Class"
					- "Comment 1"
					- "Comment 2"
					- "Comment ..."
				Comments from "Other Class"
					- "Comment 1"
					- "Comment 2"
					- "Comment ..."
		-> Let user save said documents to local machine
			[] As stated earlier, I should make a save/ load interface.
		
		
		
Ect. Notes:
	-> Need to figure out the graphics rendering. Everything should fall in place after that.
